# Discord Web Downloader

Rewrite of the old Discord-Web-Build-Archiver using Javascript. Possible C# rewrite soon I hope because bruh.

Currently WIP, it gets current Canary index.html and downloads the rest i guess. Improvements needed.

TODO:

- Download from imported index.html
- Download from wayback machine when Discord does not serve files anymore (useful for v2 clients, aka 2015-2018 ones, although you need to frankenstein assets from 2018 v6 clients I think idk haven't tried yet lmao)
